The top line is the important part and is the only thing required when creating a room. This is your "roomID" and this is what is important when telling friends or others what room to join. Once created, this room will exist forever!

The other fields are optional. Password, if used the room will require a password to be input in order for others to be able to join the room.

Once your room is created click on your room. This room will now be in your list moving forward. Rooms with a Orange "user" icon to the left of the room are rooms that you created, and that you have control over, you are the "Super Admin". If you see a grey "user" icon to the left of the

If this is your room, or you have "Admin" capabilities then the "+" icon will be in the bottom right of the screen. This is what you will click on to add songs. Click this icon and you will see the "Add Tracks" search screen:

Start typing on the search bar to begin receiving results. Right now the search is pulling from youtube. So you are essentially searching youtube. Once you find a song you like click it. Otherwise click the top x to clear your results and then close the page.

If you do not have "Admin" access in the room, and are instead just a listener, you can still click the "three dots" to the right of the track to add to any of your rooms. So if you see a song of someone elses that you like select this option to quickly add it to your own room.

The "play" icon in the top right of the black bar is a toggle switch to toggle between the room information, and the current song playing. 

## Users

The users screen gives you three options. The furthest left, first, option is the list of your friends that are currently using the app, and what room they are currently located in. You can click on any user in the list to join the room that he/she is immediately and start listening with them.

The second, middle, option is all of the users in the room that you are currently in. 

The furthest, third, option is a chat window, where you can talk with all of the users currently in the room that you are in.

## Misc

To logout click the hamburger icon in the top left, then select, "logout".
